A Tour of Go is an introduction to the Go programming language.

To install the tour from source, first
[set up a workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and then run:

	$ go get golang.org/x/tour

This will place a `tour` binary in your workspace's `bin` directory.

Unless otherwise noted, the go-tour source files are distributed
under the BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.

Contributions should follow the same procedure as for the Go project:
