      <description>What makes Go different from other programming languages is cognitive load. You can do more with less code, which makes it easier to reason about and understand the code that you do end up writing.
The majority of Go code ends up looking quite similar, so, even if you’re working with a completely new codebase, you can get up and running pretty quickly.
 &amp;mdash; Glen Balliet ,&amp;nbsp; Engineering Director of loyalty platforms &amp;nbsp;at American Express   Go Improves Microservices and Speeds Productivity Founded in 1850, American Express is a globally integrated payments company offering charge and credit card products, merchant acquisition and processing services, network services, and travel-related services.</description>

      <description>I think that the tour of Go is by far the best introduction to a language that I’ve seen, It’s really simple and it gives you a fair overview of probably 80 percent of the language. When we want to get developers to learn Go, and to get to production fast, we tell them to start with the tour of Go.  &amp;mdash; Eric Kohan ,&amp;nbsp; Software Engineering Manager &amp;nbsp;at MercadoLibre   Go helps integrated ecosystem attract developers and scale eCommerce MercadoLibre, Inc.</description>

      <title>Go for Cloud &amp; Network Services</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/cloud/</link>

      <description>Overview Go helps enterprises build and scale cloud computing systems As applications and processing move to the cloud, concurrency becomes a very big issue. Cloud computing systems, by their very nature, share and scale resources. Coordinating access to shared resources is an issue that impacts every application processing in the cloud, and requires programming languages “explicitly geared to develop highly reliable concurrent applications.”
 Go makes it very easy to scale as a company.</description>

      <title>Command-line Interfaces (CLIs)</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/clis/</link>

      <description>Overview CLI developers prefer Go for portability, performance, and ease of creation Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.
Key benefits Leverage fast compile times to build programs that start quickly and run on any system Developers of CLIs find Go to be ideal for designing their applications. Go compiles very quickly into a single binary, works across platforms with a consistent style, and brings a strong development community.</description>
