      <description>Since our NoSQL and DB proxy used quite a bit of system details in a multi-threaded mode, the code got complex managing the different conditions, given that Go provides channels and routines to deal with complexity, we were able to structure the code to meet our requirements.  &amp;mdash; Bala Natarajan ,&amp;nbsp; Sr. Director of Engineering,&amp;nbsp;Developer Experience &amp;nbsp;at PayPal   New code infrastructure built on Go PayPal was created to democratize financial services and empower people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy.</description>

      <title>American Express Uses Go for Payments &amp; Rewards</title>

      <description>What makes Go different from other programming languages is cognitive load. You can do more with less code, which makes it easier to reason about and understand the code that you do end up writing.
The majority of Go code ends up looking quite similar, so, even if you’re working with a completely new codebase, you can get up and running pretty quickly.
 &amp;mdash; Glen Balliet ,&amp;nbsp; Engineering Director of loyalty platforms &amp;nbsp;at American Express   Go Improves Microservices and Speeds Productivity Founded in 1850, American Express is a globally integrated payments company offering charge and credit card products, merchant acquisition and processing services, network services, and travel-related services.</description>

      <description>I think that the tour of Go is by far the best introduction to a language that I’ve seen, It’s really simple and it gives you a fair overview of probably 80 percent of the language. When we want to get developers to learn Go, and to get to production fast, we tell them to start with the tour of Go.  &amp;mdash; Eric Kohan ,&amp;nbsp; Software Engineering Manager &amp;nbsp;at MercadoLibre   Go helps integrated ecosystem attract developers and scale eCommerce MercadoLibre, Inc.</description>

      <title>Go for Cloud &amp; Network Services</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/cloud/</link>

      <description>Overview Go helps enterprises build and scale cloud computing systems As applications and processing move to the cloud, concurrency becomes a very big issue. Cloud computing systems, by their very nature, share and scale resources. Coordinating access to shared resources is an issue that impacts every application processing in the cloud, and requires programming languages “explicitly geared to develop highly reliable concurrent applications.”
 Go makes it very easy to scale as a company.</description>

      <title>Command-line Interfaces (CLIs)</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/clis/</link>

      <guid>https://go.dev/solutions/clis/</guid>
      <description>Overview CLI developers prefer Go for portability, performance, and ease of creation Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.
Key benefits Leverage fast compile times to build programs that start quickly and run on any system Developers of CLIs find Go to be ideal for designing their applications. Go compiles very quickly into a single binary, works across platforms with a consistent style, and brings a strong development community.</description>

      <description>Overview Go helps enterprises automate and scale Development Operations (DevOps) teams help engineering organizations automate tasks and improve their continuous integration and continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) process. DevOps can topple developmental silos and implement tooling and automation to enhance software development, deployment, and support.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) was born at Google to make the company’s “large-scale sites more reliable, efficient, and scalable,”writes Silvia Fressard, an independent DevOps consultant.</description>

      <title>Actuating Google Production: How Google’s Site Reliability Engineering Team Uses Go</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/google/sitereliability/</link>

      <description>Google runs a small number of very large services. Those services are powered by a global infrastructure covering everything a developer needs: storage systems, load balancers, network, logging, monitoring, and much more. Nevertheless, it is not a static system—it cannot be. Architecture evolves, new products and ideas are created, new versions must be rolled out, configs pushed, database schema updated, and more. We end up deploying changes to our systems dozens of times per second.</description>

      <title>Chrome Content Optimization Service Runs on Go</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/google/chrome/</link>

      <description>When the product Chrome comes to mind, you probably think solely of the user-installed browser. But behind the scenes, Chrome has an extensive fleet of backends. Among these is the Chrome Optimization Guide service. This service forms an important basis for Chrome&amp;rsquo;s user experience strategy, operating in the critical path for users, and is implemented in Go.
The Chrome Optimization Guide service is designed to bring the power of Google to Chrome by providing hints to the installed browser about what optimizations may be performed on a page load, as well as when they can be applied most effectively.</description>

      <title>How Google&#39;s Core Data Solutions Team Uses Go</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/solutions/google/coredata/</link>

      <guid>https://go.dev/solutions/google/coredata/</guid>
      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s mission is “to organize the world&amp;rsquo;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” One of the teams responsible for organizing that information is Google’s Core Data Solutions team. The team, among other things, maintains services to index web pages across the globe. These web indexing services help support products like Google Search by keeping search results updated and comprehensive, and they’re written in Go.
In 2015, to keep up with Google’s scale, our team needed to rewrite our indexing stack from a single monolithic binary written in C++ to multiple components in a microservices architecture.</description>

      <description>The Firebase Hosting team provides static web hosting services for Google Cloud customers. They provide a static web host that sits behind a global content delivery network, and offer users tools that are easy to use. The team also develops features that range from uploading site files to registering domains to tracking usage.
Before joining Google, Firebase Hosting’s tech stack was written in Node.js. The team started to use Go when they needed to interoperate with several other Google services.</description>
