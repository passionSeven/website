      <description>Overview Go helps enterprises build and scale cloud computing systems As applications and processing move to the cloud, concurrency becomes a very big issue. Cloud computing systems, by their very nature, share and scale resources. Coordinating access to shared resources is an issue that impacts every application processing in the cloud, and requires programming languages “explicitly geared to develop highly reliable concurrent applications.”
 Go makes it very easy to scale as a company.</description>

      <description>Overview CLI developers prefer Go for portability, performance, and ease of creation Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.
Key benefits Leverage fast compile times to build programs that start quickly and run on any system Developers of CLIs find Go to be ideal for designing their applications. Go compiles very quickly into a single binary, works across platforms with a consistent style, and brings a strong development community.</description>

      <description>Overview Go helps enterprises automate and scale Development Operations (DevOps) teams help engineering organizations automate tasks and improve their continuous integration and continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) process. DevOps can topple developmental silos and implement tooling and automation to enhance software development, deployment, and support.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) was born at Google to make the company’s “large-scale sites more reliable, efficient, and scalable,”writes Silvia Fressard, an independent DevOps consultant.</description>
