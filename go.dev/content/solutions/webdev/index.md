## Go delivers speed, security, and developer-friendly tools for Web Applications

Go is designed to enable developers to rapidly develop scalable and secure web applications. Go ships with an easy to use, secure and performant web server and includes it own web templating library. Go has excellent support for all of the latest technologies from [HTTP/2](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http), to databases like [MySQL](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql), [MongoDB](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver) and [ElasticSearch](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v7), to the latest encryption standards including [TLS 1.3](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls). Go web applications run natively on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) (for easy scaling) or on any environment, cloud, or operating system thanks to Go‚Äôs extreme portability.

For enterprises, Go is preferred for providing rapid cross-platform deployment. With its goroutines, native compilation, and the URI-based package namespacing, Go code executes to a single, small binary‚Äîwith zero dependencies‚Äîmaking it very fast.

‚ÄúIf you are looking for powerful tools for web programming, mobile development, microservices, and ERP systems,‚Äù [writes Andrew Smith](https://dzone.com/articles/golang-web-development-better-than-python), marketing manager at QArea. ‚ÄúGo web development has proved to be faster than using Python for the same kind of tasks in many use cases.‚Äù

{{% pullquote author="Tigran Bayburtsyan, Co-Founder and CTO at Hexact Inc." link="https://hackernoon.com/5-reasons-why-we-switched-from-python-to-go-4414d5f42690" %}}
Go Language is the easiest language that I‚Äôve ever seen and used... For me, Go is easier to learn than even JavaScript.
{{% /pullquote %}}

Bayburtsyan summarizes the five key reasons his company switched to Go:

1.   **Compiles into a single binary** ‚Äî ‚ÄúUsing static linking, Go actually combining all dependency libraries and modules into one single binary file based on OS type and architecture.‚Äù

2.   **Static type system** ‚Äî ‚ÄúType system is really important for large scale applications.‚Äù

3.   **Performance** ‚Äî ‚ÄúGo performed better because of its concurrency model and CPU scalability. Whenever we need to process some internal request, we are doing it with separate Goroutines which are 10x cheaper in resources than Python Threads.‚Äù

4.   **No need for a web framework** ‚Äî ‚ÄúIn most of the cases you really don‚Äôt need any third-party library.‚Äù

5.   **Great IDE support and debugging** ‚Äî ‚ÄúAfter rewriting all projects to Go, we got 64 percent less code than we had earlier.‚Äù

    {{% mediaListBox img-src="/images/logos/hugo.svg" img-alt="Hugo Logo"  img-link="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo" align=top  %}}
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. Hugo is one of the most popular website engines available today. Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure and can be hosted anywhere without any dependencies.

    {{% mediaListBox img-src="/images/logos/caddy.svg" img-alt="Caddy Logo"  img-link="https://caddyserver.com" title="Caddy" align=top  %}}
[Caddy 2](https://caddyserver.com) is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go. Written in Go, Caddy offers greater memory safety than servers written in C. A hardened TLS stack powered by the Go standard library serves a significant portion of all Internet traffic.

    {{% mediaListBox img-src="/images/logos/medium.svg" img-alt="Medium Logo"  img-link="https://medium.org" title="Medium" align=top  %}}
Medium gets "over 25 million unique readers every month and tens of thousands of posts published each week." Medium uses Go to power [their social graph](https://medium.engineering/how-medium-goes-social-b7dbefa6d413), their [image server and several auxiliary services](https://medium.engineering/how-medium-goes-social-b7dbefa6d413). "We‚Äôve found Go very easy to build, package, and deploy. We like the type-safety without the verbosity and JVM tuning of Java."

    {{% mediaListBox img-src="/images/logos/cloudflare-icon.svg" img-alt="Cloudflare Logo" title="Cloudflare" align="top" %}}
Cloudflare speeds up and protects millions of websites, APIs, SaaS services, and other properties connected to the Internet. "[Go is at the heart of CloudFlare's services](https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-weve-been-doing-with-go/) including handling compression for high-latency HTTP connections, our entire DNS infrastructure, SSL, load testing and more." Go's early support for TLS 1.3 enabled CloudFlare to be [one of the early adopters](https://blog.cloudflare.com/know-your-scm_rights/) of this critical improvement before OpenSSL or BoringSSL even had an implementation.

    {{% mediaListBox img-src="/images/logos/economist.svg" img-alt="Economist Logo" img-link="https://economist.com" title="The  Economist" align=top %}}
The Economist needed more flexibility to deliver content to increasingly diverse digital channels. Services written in Go was a key component of the new system that would enable The Economist to deliver scalable, high performing services and quickly iterate new products. 
[‚ÄúOverall, it was determined that Go was the language best designed for usability and efficiency in a distributed, cloud-based system.‚Äù](https://www.infoq.com/articles/golang-the-economist/)

The simplicity and safety of the Go language were a good fit for a core component of their HTTP infrastructure, and some brief experiments with the excellent net/http package convinced web developers they were on the right track. [‚ÄúIn particular, Go‚Äôs concurrency model makes it absurdly easy to build performant I/O-bound applications,‚Äù](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/05/building-a-new-router-for-gov-uk/).
