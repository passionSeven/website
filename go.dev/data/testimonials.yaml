    “At the time, no single team member knew Go, but
    <strong>within a month,everyone was writing in Go</strong> and we were
    building out the endpoints. It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use,
    and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency,
    garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us
    during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot!”

    "<strong>A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer.</strong>
    The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your
    mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve
    it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not
    working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see
    <strong>less boilerplate and more business logic.</strong>"

    “<strong>Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services
    written using it typically have very small memory footprints.</strong>
    Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be
    containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These
    attributes make <strong>Go an ideal choice for companies building
    microservices</strong>, as you can easily deploy into a highly available and
    scalable environment such as Kubernetes.”
