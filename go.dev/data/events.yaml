    All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come discuss Go and related topics.<br/>
    Go is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable distributed systems that is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized and is running head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. (<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html" rel="nofollow">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Go</a>). However, a larger-than-expected portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.<br/>
    If you&#39;re building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you&#39;re simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let&#39;s meetup.<br/>
