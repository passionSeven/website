    WWG Pune is a chapter of Women Who Go.<br/>
    We built this meetup to provide a better entry point to women who are interested in Go. We also want to provide a safe space for networking, learning and finding mentors. This group shall bring us together so we can continue to grow in Go. <br><br/>
     <br><br/>
    Even though any person can attend this meetup regardless of gender, we wish to empower the less-represented developers of the programming community.<br/>
     <br><br/>
    We would love for you to speak at Women Who Go! DM us at <a href="https://twitter.com/wwg_pune" rel="nofollow">@wwg_pune</a> about a short talk, demo, or whatever you have in mind!

    All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come discuss Go and related topics.<br/>
    Go is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable distributed systems that is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized and is running head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. (<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html" rel="nofollow">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Go</a>). However, a larger-than-expected portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.<br/>
    If you&#39;re building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you&#39;re simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let&#39;s meetup.<br/>
