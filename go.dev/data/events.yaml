    A meetup group to discuss the Go Programming Language in Jakarta. <br/>
    (from golang.org) <br/>
    The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It&#39;s a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

    All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come discuss Go and related topics.<br/>
    Go is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable distributed systems that is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized and is running head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. (<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html" rel="nofollow">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Go</a>). However, a larger-than-expected portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.<br/>
    If you&#39;re building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you&#39;re simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let&#39;s meetup.<br/>

    A forum for people working in or around Ann Arbor with Go to discuss ideas, issues and share solutions. We will start to put together meetings as the group grows and topics are suggested. <br/>
    We seek to enable underrepresented people in tech to use Go as a tool to learn and teach programming, and, ultimately, to empower underrepresented groups in tech to help increase diversity in the Go community.  No prior programming language is needed to attend! <br><br/>
    Submit a talk proposal, or come join us in #a2go channel in the gophers slack  https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/ .<br> <br>A2Go Golang adopts the Go Code of Conduct (<a href="https://golang.org/conduct#code" rel="nofollow">https://golang.org/conduct#code</a>). Harassment, bullying, and discrimination are unacceptable here and if you witness or experience those or other harmful behaviors, please let the organizers know. The Code of Conduct extends to related events like after-meeting bar trips. <br>
