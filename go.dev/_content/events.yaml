  description: "All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come discuss Go and related topics.<br/>\nGo is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable distributed systems that is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized and is running head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. (<a href=\"https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Go</a>). However, a larger-than-expected portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you&#39;re simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let&#39;s meetup.<br/>\n• More resources are available at <a href=\"http://www.euggo.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.euggo.org</a> "

     <br/>
    The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It&#39;s a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

    Women Who Go Toronto Mascot<br/>
    Our gopher friend, Meg, is designed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ellenpix" rel="nofollow">Ellen Hsiang</a>. The inspiration behind this mascot comes from the well-known photo of software pioneer Margaret Hamilton standing next to her team&#39;s tower of code for the Apollo Project. She was a champion of computer programming as a legitimate discipline, and is credited with coining the term software engineering.<br/>
    Behind Meg is the distinctive Toronto City Hall. In contrast to that other famous but pointier Toronto landmark, City Hall is a curvy harmony of parts. Two towers wrap around the saucer-like council chamber, hinting at standing figures gathering for an intimate chat. It is also the literal meeting place for City Council. Both the building and the meetings are open to the public.<br/>
    Passionate software engineers, gophers, and a welcoming community? What else but Women Who Go Toronto.<br/>
