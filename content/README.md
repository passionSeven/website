# content

The `static` directory contains static content. This content is used alongside
the content in the main Go repository by the [`golangorg`](golang.org/x/website/cmd/golangorg)
binary when serving the [golang.org](https://golang.org) website.
The details of the directory to path mapping are documented at the top of
[`cmd/golangorg/main.go`](https://go.googlesource.com/website/+/refs/heads/master/cmd/golangorg/main.go).
